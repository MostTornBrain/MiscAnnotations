# MiscAnnotations
 Add rich-text notes to any numeric "misc" field on a char sheet in Fantasy Grounds Unity.

 Overtime, I find I will often forget where various miscellaneous adjustment values came from on a character sheet.  This extension will detect any numeric writeable field that has "misc" in its name, and will add the ability to CTRL-click on it to pop up a rich text editor to provide some annotation.

 Also, after adding such annotation, the plain text version of the annotation will become a tooltip hover for the numeric field.  No need to CTRL-click if you just want a quick reminder of the text.

 This will also handle misc fields on NPC cohort character sheets used via the "Friend Zone" or "Cohorts and Companions" extension. (Misc fields likely only occur when spells are added to the NPC.)
